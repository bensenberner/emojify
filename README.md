# emojify
Life imitates emoji

I'm aiming to create an application that takes a picture, breaks it up into a grid of smaller pictures,
determines which emoji is most similar to each of those pieces of the picture, and then reconstructs the
original image entirely out of emojis.

I couldn't figure out how to download openCV onto Python 3 so this currently
uses Python 2.7
My apologies for the inconvenience.
