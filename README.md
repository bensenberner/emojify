# emojify
Life imitates emoji

I'm aiming to create an application that takes a picture, breaks it up into a grid of smaller pictures,
determines which emoji is most similar to each of those pieces of the picture, and then reconstructs the
original image entirely out of emojis.

I couldn't figure out how to download openCV onto Python 3 so this currently
uses Python 2.7. My apologies for the inconvenience. I discovered halfway
through the project that someone from the New York Times had already done what
I was attempting to do here, but with a much more sophisticated algorithm.

Also, it looks like there's already an app out there with the same name

TODO: write out the steps from shell script to execution
